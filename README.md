# CurrencyConverter

a simple application which reads from a txt file some currencies in the form of "EUR xx.xx", " xx.xx euro", "€ xx.xx" and converts it in bulgarian leva/BGN.
I have added the values of some currencies from different countries to a mySQL database. That is how I know which currency how much is converted.  
this is what my DB is looking:

id |currency |value
1	   EUR	   1.96
2	   GBP	   2.26
3	   USD	   1.75
4	   CHF	   1.77
5	   €	     1.96
6	   £	     1.75
7	   $	     2.26
8	   euro	   1.96
9	   pounds	 2.26
10	 dollars 1.75
11	 franc	 1.77
