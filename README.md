# CurrencyConverter

a simple application which reads from a txt file some currencies in the form of "EUR xx.xx", " xx.xx euro", "€ xx.xx" and converts it in bulgarian leva/BGN.
I have added the values of some currencies from different countries to a mySQL database. That is how I know which currency how much is converted.
